# **Binary Image Classification on ship dataset**
## Dataset Used: 
The dataset consists of image chips extracted from Planet satellite imagery collected over the San Francisco Bay and San Pedro Bay areas of California. It includes 4000 80x80 RGB images labeled with either a "ship" or "no-ship" classification. Image chips were derived from PlanetScope full-frame visual scene products, which are orthorectified to a 3 meter pixel size. (From Kaggle)
